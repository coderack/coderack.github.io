Tireconsumer’s aim is to be a website where consumers can research tires, compare prices and information, then decide whether to make a purchase and from where. Instead of buying the tires on the website, however, the consumer is directed to local tire dealerships that carry what they’re looking for. This lets consumers shop from the convenience of their homes, but gives the unit sale to the tire dealer.
