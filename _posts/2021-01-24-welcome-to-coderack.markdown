# New Year, New Site

It's been while since I've updated this website.  Since the last time we've update, a lot has changed at coderack.
I took a full-time job at [Epion Health](https://epionhealth.com) and now run product and engineering there.  It's been a lot
fun and I'm learning everyday.  I'm now  updating this site to more accurately reflect my professional career.

I hope you like the new changes!
