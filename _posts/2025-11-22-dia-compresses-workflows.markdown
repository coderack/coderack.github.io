I’ve been experimenting with [Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com), and the value shows up fast.

Last week I had a half-dozen Google Docs full of comments from different parts of the team open at once. Normally that’s a four- or five-step process to turn into a clear plan: read everything, switch tabs repeatedly, gather the threads, outline next steps, then clean it up for sharing.

With Dia, I linked every open Google Drive tab into a single workspace, highlighted the relevant context, and asked it to draft an execution plan based on what was open. It parsed each doc, grouped the common asks, proposed sequencing, and left placeholders where it needed clarification. I only had to tweak tone and add dates. Collaboration skills like synthesis, prioritization, and writing for different audiences suddenly happened in one pass because Dia handled the mechanical tab-hopping.

Tasks that used to take real time now take a minute, which means I can spend more energy on coaching and aligning stakeholders instead of copying feedback between docs.

The nay-sayers will say it’s not ready and ripe with a whole new host of security considerations. They’re right to be cautious. Prompt injection across tabs is a real risk, so I have one simple rule: only link trusted sources. I’m also deliberate about redacting sensitive commentary and double-checking anything that will be shared outside the core group.

Even with those constraints, it’s obvious where this is heading: a major shift from a passive browser to a trusted copilot that changes how we work. Atlassian clearly saw the same thing—after a few days with Dia I understand why they acquired it and how this could slip into the rest of their product stack.

If you’ve been trying AI-first browsers, I’m curious what they’ve unlocked for you. If you haven’t, check out Dia in the link above (and let me know if you need an invite!).
