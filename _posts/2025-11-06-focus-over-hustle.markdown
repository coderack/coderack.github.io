I have to comment on 996 and hustle culture. I get the appeal of the grind—the illusion that more hours means more success.

But I can’t do it. I have a wife and two kids who are growing up fast, and I want to be present for that. I don’t want their memory of me to be a dad who was always “heads down” or just whatever shows up on my LinkedIn profile 😉

So I’m working hard on what performance looks like for me and for my team. We don’t chase hours; we rally around focus. Every day, every week, every month we set clear objectives and drive them to completion. Then we move to the next.

No time for wasted meetings. No chasing every priority just because it fills our plates. Just alignment, intensity, and execution.

That’s how I see we can compete with this hustle-first mentality. Not with 996 energy, but with clarity and precision. Maybe I’m wrong and it won’t work out in the long run...

I’m curious—how are you approaching it? Are you still chasing hustle culture, or building leverage through focus?
