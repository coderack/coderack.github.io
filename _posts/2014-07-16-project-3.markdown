Coderack is building a white label web application tool that helps students and current professionals define a career path using Education, Skill and Wage data to determine an ROI on education and skills based on their current state. AIR had produced a 1.0 version that wasnâ€™t as successful in reaching the audience they had hoped.  In reaching out to the software development community  they selected Coderack to partner with and build them a more modern engaging version with enhanced functionality. Their goal was to align better with a younger audience and show the value of the tool through immediate and simple visualizations of data. Coderack is helping AIR achieve those goals in creating a comprehensive, innovative, and intuitive web application.
