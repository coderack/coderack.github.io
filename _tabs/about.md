I'm an engineering executive with 20 years of experience leading SaaS and healthcare technology organizations. I've spent my entire career building technology that directly helps patients get better healthcare, and I find that incredibly rewarding.

Currently, I'm the Chief Technology Officer at [Aquifer](https://aquifer.org), where I lead both product and engineering across a cross-functional team driving digital transformation in healthcare education. I manage a lean product organization of four product managers focused on shipping an AI-first platform that supports over 180,000 learners across 200 medical institutions, with systems handling 1.2M+ annual case completions.

I'm also the founder of [Wynk Health](https://wynkhealth.com), an AI-driven medical intake assistant that streamlines clinical workflows through automated patient information collection, real-time vital sign monitoring, and intelligent clinical documentation.

Before Aquifer, I was VP/Head of Engineering at [SaaSWorks (now FinQore)](https://saasworks.com), where I partnered with the founders to build a real-time analytics platform tracking over $1B in ARR. I introduced formal product leadership by recruiting a standout customer success leader to become Product Lead, ensuring customer insights shaped the roadmap. I also led the re-architecture of their backend infrastructure, which increased throughput by 10x while cutting AWS costs in half, and launched an AI chatbot that transformed how customers interact with their data.

Prior to that, I was the Chief Technology Officer at [Epion Health](https://epionhealth.com), which was acquired by [Kyruus](https://kyruus.com) in 2022. At Epion, I led both product and engineering as we scaled a high-availability patient check-in platform handling 20M+ check-ins per year, built the top-rated app in the athenahealth marketplace, and expanded EHR integrations to Epic and Cerner—increasing our addressable market by 20x. I played a key role in the company's acquisition and was offered a VP Engineering role to lead 100+ FTEs post-acquisition.

Earlier in my career, I co-founded and served as CEO of Gweepi Medical, a startup focused on innovating care in senior living through sensor-driven technology. We raised $1M in seed funding and were finalists at MassChallenge and semi-finalists at the MIT $100K business plan competition.

My career started in medical device software at [Philips](https://www.philips.com) and [Volcano Corporation](https://www.philips.com), where I worked on FDA Class II devices and gained deep experience in regulatory compliance, quality systems, and healthcare technology standards.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I graduated with Honors (Distinction).
