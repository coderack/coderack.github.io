Here’s a simple place to track the books and long-form articles I keep recommending. Update the lists below as you find new favorites.

## Books

- _Example Title_ — quick note about the takeaway or why it matters.
- Add new entries using standard Markdown bullets so the page stays easy to scan.
- [High Growth Handbook – Product Management Overview](https://growth.eladgil.com/book/chapter-7-product-management/product-management-overview/) — a go-to reference for companies that have moved past 0→1 but still need to mature their product discipline.

## Articles & Essays

- [Example Article](https://example.com) — short description of the key insight.
- Link out to the original post and add enough context that future you remembers why it was valuable.

> Tip: when something no longer resonates, delete it. The list should reflect what’s currently influencing your thinking.
