I am tech professional with over 20 years of experience. I have a day job as the CTO of [Epion Health](https://epionhealth.com).  I've been working in healthcare my whole career and I find it really rewarding.  All the technology that I develop directly helps patients get the best healthcare possible.

I occasionally consult and help lend my technical expertise to other ventures. Please reach out at
